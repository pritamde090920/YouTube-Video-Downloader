# YouTube-Video-Downloader

Using the python pytube library, I have developed this YouTube video downloader.
The program asks the user for some basic etails like link of the video which he/she wants to download and the path where it should be downloaded.
Giving these little info, any YouTube video will be downloaded at any preferred location.
